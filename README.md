# Deploying High-Availability One-Tier AWS Architecture with Terraform and Jenkins 🚀

## Project Description 📄

This project automates the deployment of a high-availability AWS architecture using Terraform and Jenkins. The architecture consists of an Auto Scaling Group and an Application Load Balancer, all deployed within a separate VPC.

The project is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1:** Deploying the AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Part 2:** Deploying the application to the AWS infrastructure using Jenkins.

## Features 📋

- **High Availability:** The architecture is deployed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability.

- **Auto Scaling:** The Auto Scaling Group ensures that the desired number of EC2 instances are always running.

- **Load Balancing:** The Application Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across the EC2 instances.

- **Security:** The EC2 instances are deployed within a private subnet and are not directly accessible from the Internet. The Application Load Balancer is deployed within a public subnet and is accessible from the Internet.

- **Infrastructure as Code:** The AWS infrastructure is deployed using Terraform.

- **Continuous Integration:** The application is deployed to the AWS infrastructure using Jenkins.

- **Continuous Delivery:** The application is deployed to the AWS infrastructure automatically whenever a change is made to the application code.

- **Self-Healing:** The Auto Scaling Group is configured to replace unhealthy EC2 instances.

- **Highly Available Architecture:** The architecture is deployed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability.

## Tools and Technologies Used 🛠️

- **AWS:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

- **Terraform:** Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

- **Jenkins:** Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

## Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources.
- Terraform installed on your local machine or Jenkins server.
- Jenkins installed and configured for your CI/CD pipeline.
